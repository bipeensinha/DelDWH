Analyzing data to forecast market trends and boost organisational performance is a crucial business activity in 
today's competitive economy. Businesses have the problem of collecting and analysing massive amounts of data and 
converting them into profits as they continue to use information technology (IT) for an increasing number of 
operations. In response, the retail industry in particular is trying to revisit and upgrade its business strategies by 
introducing Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Warehousing (DW). DW is becoming necessary nowadays for the retail sector in India and is widely accepted for state-of-the-art 
decision support. 
Reliance Trends is largest apparel chain in India with more than 12000 stores and 100+ brands. In order to make better decision 
using the historical data available within the organization they were facing difficulty because they did'nt have 
a centralized system for extracting data. In an attempt to address this shortcoming, several departments within the retail company 
found their own resources, use different data available and hired consultants to solve their individual short-term
 data needs. In many cases, the same data was extracted from the same source systems to be accessed by separate 
departments without any strategic overall information-delivery strategy. The management realized the negative 
effect the different sources of the data has on the reports presented by the managers as the lack of integration.
A data warehouse is the foundation for powerful data analysis, it supports business decision by encouraging 
manager and other users of the company to examine data and carry out analysis in a better way.
